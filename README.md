## Highlight <a name="highlight"></a>
We propose "**E**fficiency through **T**hinking **A**head" (ETA), an asynchronous dual-system that pre-processes information from past frames using a large model in tandem with processing the current information with a small model to enable real-time decisions with strong performance.
